25889,"A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA (BRE) plans to rival France's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA, Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday. Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher, mineral water firm Multico, and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $120 million, with finance provided by BRE. The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch's shares, the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange. ""This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital, preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions,"" the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying, without giving a name. A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September, the daily said. News-stand chain Ruch, which controls about 65 percent of Poland's press distribution market, had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995. It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism. Zycie Warszawy said the new, open consortium, which also included several listed Polish firms, would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans. It aims to invest $200 million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets. Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity. Two consortia -- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms -- placed initial bids. But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette. Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch, in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled. -- Anthony Barker +48 22 653 9700 ","['C18', 'C181', 'C183', 'CCAT']"
25875,"Russian President Boris Yeltsin has yet to endorse a peace accord signed by his security chief, Alexander Lebed, with rebel leaders to end more than 20 months of fighting in breakaway Chechnya. Instead of congratulating his envoy, Yeltsin refrained on Saturday from comment on the deal, hammered out in more than eight hours of talks in the North Caucasus. Furthermore, Kremlin officials indicated that Lebed had some explaining to do. Lebed claimed to have succeeded, where many other Russian leaders previously failed, in finding a compromise to resolve a conflict in which more than 30,000 people have been killed. But he now clearly has his work cut out to convince the Russian leadership, military and public that he has not given in to the rebels, who greeted him like a hero. Kremlin officials said Yeltsin, now on holiday outside Moscow, needed time to consider the agreement and expected a full report from Lebed clarifying changes introduced during the latest round of negotiations. Yeltsin's spokesman, who has faced a barrage of awkward questions about the 65-year-old president's health since his virtual disappearance from public life in June, said Yeltsin should be allowed to rest and act as he saw fit. ""The president must have the right to take a break and the president must have room for manoeuvre. I think that we cannot refuse him that,"" Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Russian television. The Chechnya deal signed by Lebed consolidated a week-old official ceasefire and military agreement which he reached earlier after some of the worst fighting in more than a year. It would defer a decision for five years on whether the region should remain part of Russia or become independent and it would set up a joint commission to oversee economic reconstruction and the withdrawal of Russian troops. Russian officials had backed the essence of the agreement before Lebed's latest talks with the rebels, but delegates to the negotiations admitted there had been some changes. ""The talks were based on the draft agreement which we had brought with us,"" liberal parliamentarian Vladimir Lukin, who accompanied Lebed, told Russian television. ""Of course the Chechens who were conducting the talks...put their teeth into it."" Lukin did not elaborate on what changes the Chechens had introduced, but he said that a lot now depended on how Russia used the five-year breathing space laid down in the deal, saying things could go wrong if Russia was ""obstinately wilful"". Other liberal politicians and human rights activists urged Yeltsin at a rally of several hundred people in a central square in Moscow to back the deal. Speakers said the rally, called to oppose the war, had become a celebration. ""Instead of a protest meeting we are holding a meeting of hope...Hail to the peace deal!"" said human rights activist Anatoly Shabad. In Chechnya, independence-seeking rebels greeted the deal with exuberant celebrations, driving triumphantly through the streets and firing in the air. Their reaction stoked fears by Russian military officials, who are squabbling with the rebels over troop withdrawals agreed in earlier talks , that they will treat the agreement as a victory and use it to grab power in the region.
