As of Sunday, 76 percent of Iowa's corn crop had been cultivated for the first time, about six days ahead of last year's pace and one week ahead of the five-year average of 61 percent. The crop was rated three percent poor, 17 percent fair, 60 percent good and 20 percent excellent. Three percent of the soybean crop was blooming, just below the four percent for the five-year average. Soybeans were rated one percent very poor, four percent poor, 24 fair, 56 percent good and 15 percent excellent. There were reports of corn borers and leaf hoppers in the northwest, northeast, east central, southwest and south central districts, the report said. Some soybeans were damaged by post-emergence herbicide application, particularly in the northeast, east central and central districts. ""Overall, Iowa farmers are optimistic about the 1997 crop at this point,"" the report said. Topsoil moisture was rated eight percent short, 83 percent adequate and nine percent surplus.

697430,"A Berlin court acquitted a left-wing German politician on Monday who had been charged with aiding and supporting guerrilla acts with information linked to her home page on the Internet. The court ruled that Angela Marquardt, 25, a former deputy leader of Germany's reform communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), could not be held responsible for the contents of a magazine Germans could access via a so-called ""hyperlink"" on her home page. It ruled that she had made the magazine accessible before it published instructions in June last year for anti-nuclear activists on how to sabotage railway lines. It said she could not be punished for merely maintaining the hyperlink. A hyperlink is a section of highlighted text on a page which can be viewed on the World Wide Web, the popular graphical part of the Internet computer network. By clicking on the hyperlink with a computer mouse, the user is given immediate access to another computer across the Internet where the linked page has been stored. The decision is fresh evidence of a new trend in the short history of Internet regulation that seems to reflect the view that liability for illegal material should rest with the author, not other users who link to the documents or the network operators who provide access to the Internet. Early attempts to impose stricter controls on freedom of expression over the Internet are also being overturned as shown by a ruling in the United States to overturn the Communications and Decency Act, which sought to ban pornography and other material considered indecent by the bill's authors. The Berlin court said it would be difficult to order users to make constant checks for illegal information on Internet pages made accessible by hyperlink because there was no legal basis for this. Prosecutors in the first trial in Germany to examine the possible legal consequences of using hyperlinks on the Internet had called on the Berlin court to set a 3,000 mark ($1,720) fine for what they argued was illegal. The court's verdict is likely to set a precedent on the issue of whether it is illegal for someone to lead users to Internet content that is ""suspect"", even when those writings are not included in their own home page. Marquart's Internet address offers a hyperlink to Radikal magazine, a publication banned from publishing an article in Germany with instructions on how to sabotage railways lines, a tactic of anti-nuclear protesters. Although Radikal's Internet magazine stems from a computer in the Netherlands, prosecutors had argued that Marquardt aided and abetted the original crime because her home page allows others access to Radikal.
